### 1. (PHP/HTML)
Write a PHP class that inherits from PHP's ArrayObject class. Give your new class a public function called
displayAsTable() that outputs all the set keys and values as an HTML table. Instantiate an instance of this
class, set some keys for the object, and call the object's displayAsTable() function to display your data as
an HTML table.
NOTE: Use functionality inherited from ArrayObject.
### 2. (JS/HTML/CSS)
Using HTML and CSS make a plain white web page that has a 100x100 pixel blue square on it. Position
the square along the left side of the page, 50 pixels from the top. Using javascript animate this square so
that it moves 10 pixels right and 10 pixels down per second. When the box hits or goes over an edge of
the window, change the direction for the related axis.
NOTE: Please use OOP JS or ES6. Please don’t use any javascript framework (e.g. jquery)
### 3. (MySQL)
Given the two tables below, write a SQL query that uses a join statement to list all users from the user
table, their average correct answers, as well as the time of their most recently taken test. All user entries
should appear, even if they have not taken a test.

### Table: user
| user_id  | first_name | last_name |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| 1        | Bob        | Sanders   |
| 2        | Dave       | Greggers  |
| 3        | Susan      | Bowie     |
| 4        | Gary       | Anderson  |

### Table: test_result
| user_id | test_id | correct | time_taken          |
|---------|---------|---------|---------------------|
| 1       | 1       | 88      | 2012-09-02 13:01:28 |
| 3       | 2       | 56      | 2012-09-03 9:39:02  |
| 1       | 2       | 44      | 2012-09-05 16:22:11 |
| 2       | 3       | 97      | 2012-09-15 11:27:51 |
| 3       | 4       | 22      | 2012-09-15 15:01:49 |
